# Projection-Method-applied-to-Navier-Stokes-equations
Purpose of the following project is to go through an analysis of the results obtained from the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in a 2-dimensional staggered grid, following a Projection Method procedure. Data is then post-processed and analyses. The effects of different parameters are analysed, as for instance the effect of Reynolds Number, the boundary conditions or the resolution at which the simulation is performed.
